Horror story: liability for the open source stewards

OS wants to show attestation so that it is not liable
 
Natural person is most vulnerable in the supply chain. The natural person is vulnerable, they don't have money. They may be jointly liable. Looking at the cost;

Focus on transparency! One criterium as engineering team to choose OS is : is this project attested? Cheaper to attest a project than to trying to figure it.

Is it cheaper to attest itself

## What exactly should be attested for?
 
Trustable software project, available on Eclipse website is good example of outcome-based attestation

It follows this structure:
- Provenance
- Construction
- updatability
- confidence that it does what it does
- human assessment of harm possibly caused

Outcome is like a credit score
- You can use Linux distro until A3. 
- Attestation as a feature. So you can start to trust software.

## Open source due diligence

Manufacturers must address:
- What is the risk for the company to onboard the OS project?
- If component has attestation, it doesn't mean you don't need to test component.
- And if you choose them, do you fund it?

Manufacturers will have to do heavy due diligence all the time. For open source stewards it's not an obligation
 
## Open questions:

- If OS stewards gets donations and invests in attestation, do the freeriders just enjoy?
- OS stewards can offer their attestations for a fee.
- Will leveraging the attestation force the corporations to disclose the OS projects they are using (even if they don't have attestations)?
- Some OS projects will not fall under definition of CRA. Or they will do testing themselves.
 
## Definition

Article 3(48) provides a concerning definition
Certain Projects will fall in a gap of CRA:

What about projects that sell OS, but don't make it available on the market. Then is it not OS?

What about forking the code : then you are changing the entity, and changing the attestation (if it has one). Does this impact qualification under CRA definition?

Example: Open tofu

Polyform non-commercial: states explicitly that this is not for commercial use.

MIT/Apache 2 license require you to disclose the open source.

Attestation for end users

Another purpose for attestation is transparency towards end users

Example: director of schools that need to show that software has attestation, "it's safe to use."

Some OS projects are used by governments. Shouldn't they consider third party attestation, because of responsibility towards users?

Certain OS projects could consider attestation because of moral responsibility rather than legal obligation

## What is heavy weight attestation?
 
Free access to standards

Follows structure of vertical standards

Example: VPNs. Standards that start from use case will be free. It will start from capability. These will be open source. CENELEC/ETSI: in practice it's 99% are the products relying on OS, not just 90%.

No productivity suite in Libreoffice.

You need a main type attestation that works for different OS projects. You need transparency for users. You don't want to end up with Linux distro.

Problem is that big tech is out of this discussion
 
Concern is that big tech comes out with standard which is proprietary.

Heavy weight attestation may bring in some heavy weight players. So that bigger manufacturers come in and pay most. Why would contributions for compliance be treated differently than contributions than adding features than code maintenance.

Rules for attestation needed. Extra hands are needed to support compliance, rather than just throwing cash into it.

Commons vs. proprietary attestation

Nothing prevents open source steward from publicly publishing attestation.

Commons: secure attestation is common responsibility

Long term goal: clear requirements for guidance from stewards to manufacturers

ASF: you cannot pay people to do something, to develop something. So you cannot support some projects financially.
