# Proposals For Discussion

How do you think Article 25 can support Open Source Stewards? Already working on it, and have an example you'd like to share? 

We would like to hear from you! 

## How To Share A Proposal

Please title your proposal file with your name or handle and add it to the
table below, along with a short description. This will help the group
to organize and schedule discussions with authors present, and help other
participants find proposals of interest more quickly. 

As proposals come in, we will coordinate group discussions and compile an analysis of the pros, cons, and second-order impacts of each.
