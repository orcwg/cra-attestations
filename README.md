## Overview

This Project's purpose is to explore the topic of, and eventually publish
guidance regarding, voluntary security attestations for open source projects per
Article 25 of the Cyber Resilience Act. 

These attestations can help support the maintenance and security of open source
projects in exchange for lowering the compliance burdens of manufacturers which
use those projects in commercial products on the European market.

Our current goal is to create a mature proposal by Q2 of 2026.

## Article 25 (quote for reference)

    **Security attestation of free and open-source software**

    In order to facilitate the due diligence obligation set out in Article 13(5),
    in particular as regards manufacturers that integrate free and open-source
    software components in their products with digital elements, the Commission is
    empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 61 to supplement
    this Regulation by establishing voluntary security attestation programmes
    allowing the developers or users of products with digital elements qualifying
    as free and open-source software as well as other third parties to assess the
    conformity of such products with all or certain essential cybersecurity
    requirements or other obligations laid down in this Regulation.
