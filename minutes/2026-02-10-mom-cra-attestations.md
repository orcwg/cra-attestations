## Notes

- Prep of the CRA EG \- Attestation topic covered during this call, there will be separate WG calls for the the EG meeting as a whole as did for the previous one.  
- Minutes approved and merged.

### Survey Attestation

- Please share it \- [https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/runner/CRA-Attestation-Survey-2026-FOSDEM](https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/runner/CRA-Attestation-Survey-2026-FOSDEM)   
- FSFE is launching its own, but there are differences, so it is worth answering both.  
- Mathias \- raises concern that the “1-5” value selection has no “N/A” option, so there may be some data skew for folks who do not know how it applies to them. We should review the data for this and account for it if present.   
  - Could indicate potential areas for follow-up.  
- Aiming for 100 \- 200 responses.  
- Juan to communicate a closing date to encourage people to complete it this week.

### CRA-EG prep

- Ideal outcome: feedback on what can COMM do, what can Member States do. Avoiding auditing tax levied on manufacturers, in a way that does not benefit OSS. Ensuring that the € ⇒ helps sustain OSS and improving security.  
- Recommended approach: bring specific proposals FOR and AGAINST certain actions or regulatory outcomes in the delegated act. Then ask for feedback.  
- Mathias raises an example of the lack of opt-in/opt-out mechanism for “who is a steward”.   
- Aeva notes two relevant topics (changing member state tax code and criminal codes) which COMM can’t answer, and Tobie suggests the middle ground is still good & community should represent its positions. 

- Dirk-Willem recommends being mindful of the Pareto Effect.

### FOSDEM activities:

- I found the blog from OpenSSF to be thought provoking (Greg)  
 

### Two-tier proposal

- ..Aeva asks everyone to consider the cost and possibility of achieving heavyweight. Dirk-Willem emphasises that it is basically necessary for many segments of the market (if you are in need of the heavy-weight \- you probably already do a lot of other stuff that attracts that level of professionalism; and are used to it).  
- Aeva asks everyone to review and comment on [GitHub issue](https://github.com/orcwg/cra-attestations/pull/20).

Call for Interest in Collaborating on Attestation Access Guidance (Greg)

- The perspective Greg has started with for this “proposal” is thinking about the role of the CRA and Attestations as they relate to open source sustainability. This applies mostly to independent open source projects and projects “hosted” within non-profit organizations.   
- Interest from:  
  - Salve, Mathias, Alistair, Dirk-Willem  
- “If Voluntary Security Attestations (VSAs) are going to contribute to open source sustainability, Maintainers and Stewards need to define the terms under which they will make the VSAs available to Manufacturers.  
- There are any number of options, ranging from making them free, to charging a flat fee, to charging a graduated fee based on Manufacturer headcount or annual revenue, to including access to the Attestation in Open Source Foundation Membership Benefits. We can approach this using the Four Ps of marketing \- Product, Price, Place, and Promotion.”  
- Aeva’s proposal – Stewards’ costs should be transparent and shared by commercial beneficiaries in a proportional manner, and to ensure this, Stewards should be run as a not-for-profit.  
- Dirk-Willem adds that it is hard to do attestation based on observation/hearsay from \`afar’ \- so an entity  doing an attestation benefits from a direct relation with the open source stewards. Secondly \- issuing a totally generic attestation is non trivial/not what is commonly done in the market for (low cost) attestation; these tend to include a scope tailored to the downstream. The latter would imply that attestation are fairly 1:1 issues to a specific downstream entity in return for a payment. And perhaps not even transitive from thereon. And the first implies a certain ability by the open source stewards to gate, to determine whom they give \`first hand/first order’ access to the information required to do the attestation. And this is something where an implementing act can help clarify perhaps ??

### Positioning of CRA Attestations 

- TBD: some public blog post or statement about the holistically beneficial potential of Art.25
