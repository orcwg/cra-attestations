## Notes

### Welcome & approve agenda

- Welcome from Æva and reference to the [https://github.com/orcwg/cra-attestations](https://github.com/orcwg/cra-attestations)

- Round of Introductions from all attendees.

### Intro to the task force and objectives


- The [Repository](https://github.com/orcwg/cra-attestations) is the hub for this workstream.  
  - Rising awareness.  
  - Coordinating work.  
- Track the work in the repository to collect inputs in the repository:  
  - Ideas  
  - Already published work in the field  
- Set of guidelines target different scenarios that could end up as recommendations that can be shared later next year (6-7 months).  
- The plan is to use this workstream to draft the recommendations to the European Commission.  
- We’ll figure out how to contribute to a potential delegated act on the topic.  
- In later stages, we should develop kind of checklist, it will keep it in mind and revisit it in later stages of the work. Idea proposed 
  - Use the checklist to build an independent  ISO, etc submission 
  - or fed into ETSI via an IETF ID->RFC stream  
- For those who have materials, please open a PR to submit them

### Contribution guidelines \- how to make a proposal

- Open a Pull Request and submit your proposals and contributions 
  - contact either Æva or Juan in case of problems.

### CRA Attestation workshop @ Code & Compliance

- Introduction to the objectives of the workshop.  
- Maintain the focus on open source and what the CRA points to as a framework for the development of attestations.  
- Breakout sessions, two high-level scopes  
  - Stewards  
  - Independent projects  
- Art. 25 clarifies the entities that are enabled to develop attestations.  
- We may want to develop guidance on how to transition from an independent open source project to a stewarded project
  - it won’t be covered during the workshop, but this is an important aspect that should be considered
  - would be a useful contribution to public guidance for open source communities
- Feedback about the challenges:  
  - We’ll organize by the beginning of the day the challenges to make sure that we have enough people contributing to them.  
- We’ll open a space to have discussions about what could be included  
- *Comment: It might be interesting to also consider the opposite of positive attestations. Attesting that things were not done / evidence is absent. That gives a clear statement on how a project is intended to be used.*

### Next Steps in the CRA Attestations work

- Get ready for the workshop  
  - After the workshop, Æva will share slides with cra-attestations project.  
- Contributes to the proposals folder via Pull requests

### AOB

- None
