## Notes

- Agenda approved  
- Minutes approved will be marked as approved after the call  
- AP2 \- Trying to set up a call, following up over the email. No meeting at FOSDEM needed, since this is a US-centric issue and there are already known-confirmations (ASF, FreeBSD)

### Tobie’s presentation

* “Ecosystem sustainability programme” at OpenJS Fdn  
  * Not a specific example of VSAs – but an example of an experimentation with a business model to enable sustainability in FOSS  
  * ESP Partners fork EOL projects into proprietary+patched releases to relicense to commercial entities.   
  * Relies on permissive licenses. Trademark not applicable / retained by OpenJS.  
  * OSS proj. Website promotes the ESPP forked version.  
  * Foundation and project get revenue sharing.  
  * “Delayed Dual Licensing”  
* Q: could this work for GPL?  
* Q: is patched version only “sold” to one (or specific) customers? *Yes*  
  * Note: CRA may require the contribution of the patches back upstream\!

### Main Proposal

* [https://github.com/orcwg/cra-attestations/pull/11](https://github.com/orcwg/cra-attestations/pull/11)  
* Proposed to merge- could be \< 5 issues to continue discussions not closed.  
* Please submit proposals of models, don’t worry about the format but share the content with the group.

Revenue management and business model, it was started a discussion around the topic:

- What is the role of legislation in building and enabling this business model?  
- It was presented the possibility of using regulation to roce business models that otherwise won’t be possible to be implemented.

- CRA Attestatoins and  substantial modifications figure, how this is impacted
